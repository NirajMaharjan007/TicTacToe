## Getting Started

Welcome to the *Java world*. It is done from **Vs Code**.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain *Java* sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies like jar

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

`bin` will be created if vs code complies it.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.
